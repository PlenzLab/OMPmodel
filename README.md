# OMPmodel
Python code implementing the OMP model described in Pajevic et al, "Oligodendrocyte-mediated Myelin Plasticity", eLife, 2023

The code in ompsimulator.py was originally used to generate the data used in the manuscript and is kept as such.
To generate scripts for running all simulations use generate_scripts.py and auxilary text file specifying the grid of values to be explored.
An example for the Appendix table in [1]
